<h3>CONTEXT:</h3>
Paragraph_Semantic_Similarity_Analysis_App can quantify the degree of similarity between the two text-based on Semantic similarity. Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) assesses the degree to which two sentences are semantically equivalent to each other. Applications that leverage semantic similarity can have a wide range of uses across various fields like Information Retrieval and Search Engines,Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis,Recommendation Systems,Plagiarism Detection etc

<h3>AIM:</h3>
Aim is to predict a value between 0-1 indicating the similarity between the pair of text paras.

1. To preprocess and clean the dataset.
2. To explore and visualize the dataset.
3. To embed the whole sentence using a pretrained sentence-transformer model.
4. To calculate the angular distance using cosinesimilarity
5. To evaluate the performance of the model.
6. To Create an app using streamlit library   .
7. To make use of streamlit API and deploy the model and make predictions on new data.

<h3>SOURCE OF THE DATASET USED:</h3>
The data contains a pair of paragraphs. These text paragraphs are randomly sampled from a raw dataset. Each pair of sentences may or may not be semantically similar.This data is provided by an inc as a part of assessment test


<h2>Guideline to Access Project</h2>

Go for the semantic_simil_app.py file.There is all you needed.For visualisation things go to Semantic_simil.ipynb
