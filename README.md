<h3>CONTEXT:</h3>
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a general term used to describe heart or blood vessel diseases. Blood flow to the heart, brain or body can be reduced because of a blood clot build-up of fatty deposits inside an artery, leading to the artery hardening and narrowing .Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide, accounting for approximately 31% of all deaths globally. Early diagnosis and prevention of CVDs are crucial.

<h3>AIM:</h3>
Aim is to predict a value between 0-1 indicating the similarity between the pair of text paras.

1. To explore and visualize the dataset.
2. To preprocess and clean the dataset.
3. To build a machine learning model to predict the risk of CVDs.
4. To evaluate the performance of the model.
5. To fine-tune the model to improve its performance.
6. To deploy the model and make predictions on new data.

<h3>SOURCE OF THE DATASET USED:</h3>
The data contains a pair of paragraphs. These text paragraphs are randomly sampled from a raw dataset. Each pair of sentences may or may not be semantically similar.This data is provided by an inc as a part of assessment test

<h3>FEATURES:</h3>

01. age        :			age in days
02. gender     :			Gender | 1: female, 2: male
03. height     :			Height-(cm)
04. weight     :			Weight-(kg)
